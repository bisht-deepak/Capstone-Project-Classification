# Classification - Credit Card Default Prediction

## Background:
Credit card default prediction is a critical task in the financial industry. Accurately identifying potential defaulters allows financial institutions to manage risks effectively and make informed lending decisions.

## Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a credit card holder is likely to default on payments based on various financial and demographic features. The model aims to assist financial institutions in assessing the creditworthiness of applicants and reducing the risk of default.

## Objective:
The primary goal is to create a reliable predictive model that classifies credit card users into default and non-default categories. The model should provide insights into the key features influencing default predictions, enabling financial institutions to make more informed lending decisions.

## Deliverables:

1. A well-documented classification model for predicting credit card default.
2. Feature analysis highlighting the most influential factors in predicting defaults.
3. Recommendations for mitigating risks based on the model's findings.

## Success Criteria:
The success of the project will be measured by the model's accuracy in predicting credit card defaults. Additionally, identifying and understanding the key features contributing to default predictions will contribute to the project's success.
