# Classification - Credit Card Default Prediction

## Background:
The aim of this project is to develop a robust credit card default prediction model using historical data from a financial institution. By leveraging various client attributes, payment history, and billing statements, the project seeks to accurately predict the likelihood of a client defaulting on their credit card payments. Through the implementation of advanced machine learning techniques, the model aims to provide valuable insights for risk assessment and proactive measures to minimize financial losses for the institution.

## Problem Statement:
The financial institution faces significant challenges in managing credit card default risk, which can lead to substantial financial losses. The lack of a reliable and accurate system for predicting client defaults has resulted in inefficiencies in risk management and a subsequent increase in non-performing assets. The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can effectively identify clients at a higher risk of default based on their historical credit card usage patterns, payment behaviors, and other relevant attributes. By accurately identifying potential defaulters, the institution can proactively implement risk mitigation strategies and optimize its credit assessment process, ultimately minimizing financial losses and ensuring a more stable and secure credit portfolio.
## Objective:
The primary goal is to create a reliable predictive model that classifies credit card users into default and non-default categories. The model should provide insights into the key features influencing default predictions, enabling financial institutions to make more informed lending decisions.

## Deliverables:

1. A well-documented classification model for predicting credit card default.
2. Feature analysis highlighting the most influential factors in predicting defaults.
3. Recommendations for mitigating risks based on the model's findings.

## Success Criteria:
The success of the project will be measured by the model's accuracy in predicting credit card defaults. Additionally, identifying and understanding the key features contributing to default predictions will contribute to the project's success.
